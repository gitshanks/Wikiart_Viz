                            Over the years, with the development of their life styles, arts are methods of expressing
                            the artist's emotions, imaginations, ideas, and visions.
                            As shown in the graph, there are not many records of arts until 1800. With the time of the
                            industrial revolution, from 1760 to 1850, the arts started becoming popular.
                            After the end of the second world war, around 1950, the number of arts reaches to peak
                            because there were many art movements started.

                        <p>Let’s break down the types of the arts over the years. The arts can be painting or the others
                            such as sculptures and objects. As shown in the graph, over the years, most of the arts are
                            paintings.
                            Around 1900, artists started creating other than paintings. They started creating
                            sculptures, figures, or art on the streets.

                        <p>Painting faces has always been popular over the years. In art history, portrait paintings
                            shows powerful status of the rich. Over the years, there are a few arts depicting a body.
                            Interestingly, in the 1900s, instead of drawing face or body, the artists started drawing
                            more like scenery or buildings. 20th century is also known as art movements such as
                            modernism, cubism, futurism.
                            With the invention of camera in 1800s, people preferred pictures of themselves more than a
                            painitng. As the technology got better and better, the trend of a face/body painting has
                            reduced.

                <div class="col-1">
                    We’ve used the provided dataset that is preprocessed and cleaned.
                    So we did not perform any additional pre-process for this project.
                    <br><br><br>
                </div>

                <h4><b>Design Process</b></h4>
                <div class="col-1">
                    <p>
                        Our design process consists of the mainly following steps:
                        <br><br>
                        1. An initial brainstorming meeting where we checked the website of the dataset, looked at some
                        art pieces, read about the art history to gain background knowledge.<br>
                        2. We came up with possible visualizations and sketched some visualizations.<br>
                        3. Using python script, we computed people's correlations between emotions and mean ratings to
                        see if we can find some interesting.<br>
                        4. Since we picked option 2, we used Tableau to generate visualization.<br>

                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
                </div>

                <h4><b>Above And Beyond</b></h4>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        <b>Style:</b> To keep the style consistent, we use a template downloaded from the <a
                            href="https://onepagelove.com">One Page Love</a>.
                        Then,
                        we
                        adjusted the style sheet to keep the style consistent across the webpage.<br><br>

                        <b>Interesting Tasks:</b> Three visualizations show the correlation between the sentiments and
                        rating
                        values. The plot between the happiness and rating shows that there is a strong correlation. On
                        the
                        other hand, the surprise is negatively correlated with mean rating. They show that the emotion
                        on
                        the arts has some relationships to the ratings. If the arts are happier, then people tend to
                        like
                        them. Some other emotions, like sadness were not related to ratings.<br><br>
                        <b>Integrate Imagery:</b> After plotting the correlations between happiness and rating, it would
                        be
                        more insightful if we actually map each data point to the art images so that we can look and
                        compare the arts. To achieve this, we selected a couple of key artworks, then added those
                        hyperlinks to the art info pages. This provided more context to the visualizations.<br><br>


                        <b>Coordinated Views:</b> Firstly, we plot the number of art pieces over the years. Then, we
                        found that there
                        is a spike around the year 1960s. We kept explorating the data to see what is the underlying
                        reasons for the spike. We checked if that’s the paining or not. Not paining arts contributed to
                        the spike, but it is not as high as the one we saw in the first plot. Then, we also plot graph
                        depending on face, body, netiehr. As the graph shows, the number of arts that are not face nor
                        body increased that year. One plot with the number of arts over the years helps to see the
                        overall trends of arts. The other plots with specific types of arts help to see how the types of
                        arts changed and what arts they work on.
